This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. I'm using this to demonstrate using R and R Notebooks.

```{r include=FALSE}
data <- read_csv("multipleChoiceResponses.csv")
```

```{r}
dim(data)
```

```{r}
data %>%
  group_by()
```

```{r}

```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
