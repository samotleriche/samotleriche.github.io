I have created this website using the R programming language. If you're like me, you had no idea that was possible (But it is!). I am using it to not only host my resume in a convenient place online, but also to make use of the [Github](www.github.com) pages to host some examples of projects I have been doing in the R programming language. Until very recently (Dec. 2018), I was working as a Graduate Research Assistant at the [University of New Mexico, Anderson School of Management](https://www.mgt.unm.edu/). I conducted research related to alternative medicine for Dr. Karen Patterson and also helped to organize two professional development workshops in Research on Stigmatization [(Academy of Management)](https://aom.org/).

I graduated from the [University of Puget Sound](https://www.pugetsound.edu/) with a BSc in Molecular and Cellular Biology in 2014. Afterwards, I worked in the medical field as an EMT-B before returned to my home state to begin working toward my MSc in Information Systems and Assurance  [University of New Mexico, Anderson School of Management](https://msisa.mgt.unm.edu/default.asp?dd=masters). I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant until graduating in Dec. 2018. My concentrations during my master's were databases and data analysis.

My current interests include programming in R (and secondly in Python), iOS development, and staying up-to-date on the latest in machine learning and data analysis in general.
